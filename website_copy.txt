## FAQ SECTION
Label: Trust Builder
Headline: Objection Killer
Subtext: Everything you need to know before we scale together. No hidden fees, no surprises.

1. Is this real UGC or AI UGC?
   Answer: We specialize in AI UGC. This means we use AI avatars and synthesized voices to create 'user-generated' style content without the hassle of shipping products or managing creators. It's faster, cheaper, and perfectly consistent.

2. What formats do you deliver?
   Answer: We deliver AI Static Ads and AI Video Ads. Whether you need scroll-stopping image variations or high-retention video hooks, our AI engine generates platform-native assets for Meta, TikTok, and YouTube.

3. Do I need to send you the product?
   Answer: No. Since we create AI-generated visuals and avatars, we don't need physical product samples. We use your existing high-res images and brand assets to train our models and generate the ads.

4. What if I don't like the videos?
   Answer: We offer unlimited revisions. If an AI avatar's delivery feels off or a hook doesn't land, we regenerate it instantly. Our goal is 100% satisfaction before you launch.

5. Is there a long-term contract?
   Answer: Never. We operate on a month-to-month flat rate. You can pause or cancel anytime if your creative needs change. We earn your business every single month.

## MANIFESTO PAGE
Headline: The Creative Manifesto.
Text:
We believe the old way of advertising is dead. The era of spending weeks on a single "hero video" and praying it works is over.

Today, volume is the new variable for success.

But volume without quality is just noise. That's why we built Media House. To bridge the gap between high-frequency content and brand-safe quality.

Our Core Beliefs:
1. Speed is a feature. If it takes 2 weeks to ship an ad, the trend is already gone. We ship in 24 hours.
2. Data over opinions. We don't care what we "like". We care what the algorithm rewards.
3. Fatigue is the enemy. The only way to win is to out-produce the decay of your winning ads.
